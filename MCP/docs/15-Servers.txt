Getting started
​
Using reference servers
TypeScript-based servers can be used directly with npx:


Copy
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
Python-based servers can be used with uvx (recommended) or pip:


Copy
# Using uvx
uvx mcp-server-git

# Using pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
​
Configuring with Claude
To use an MCP server with Claude, add it to your configuration:


Copy
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
