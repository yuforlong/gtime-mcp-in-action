Understanding roots in MCP

Roots are a concept in MCP that define the boundaries where servers can operate. They provide a way for clients to inform servers about relevant resources and their locations.

​
What are Roots?
A root is a URI that a client suggests a server should focus on. When a client connects to a server, it declares which roots the server should work with. While primarily used for filesystem paths, roots can be any valid URI including HTTP URLs.

For example, roots could be:


Copy
file:///home/user/projects/myapp
https://api.example.com/v1
​
Why Use Roots?
Roots serve several important purposes:

Guidance: They inform servers about relevant resources and locations
Clarity: Roots make it clear which resources are part of your workspace
Organization: Multiple roots let you work with different resources simultaneously
​
How Roots Work
When a client supports roots, it:

Declares the roots capability during connection
Provides a list of suggested roots to the server
Notifies the server when roots change (if supported)
While roots are informational and not strictly enforcing, servers should:

Respect the provided roots
Use root URIs to locate and access resources
Prioritize operations within root boundaries
​
Common Use Cases
Roots are commonly used to define:

Project directories
Repository locations
API endpoints
Configuration locations
Resource boundaries
​
Best Practices
When working with roots:

Only suggest necessary resources
Use clear, descriptive names for roots
Monitor root accessibility
Handle root changes gracefully
​
Example
Here’s how a typical MCP client might expose roots:


Copy
{
  "roots": [
    {
      "uri": "file:///home/user/projects/frontend",
      "name": "Frontend Repository"
    },
    {
      "uri": "https://api.example.com/v1",
      "name": "API Endpoint"
    }
  ]
}
This configuration suggests the server focus on both a local repository and an API endpoint while keeping them logically separated.
