In-depth guide to using the MCP Inspector for testing and debugging Model Context Protocol servers

The MCP Inspector is an interactive developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers. While the Debugging Guide covers the Inspector as part of the overall debugging toolkit, this document provides a detailed exploration of the Inspector’s features and capabilities.

​
Getting started
​
Installation and basic usage
The Inspector runs directly through npx without requiring installation:


Copy
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector <command>

Copy
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector <command> <arg1> <arg2>
​
Inspecting servers from NPM or PyPi
A common way to start server packages from NPM or PyPi.

NPM package
PyPi package

Copy
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx <package-name> <args>
# For example
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mcp-server-git --repository ~/code/mcp/servers.git
​
Inspecting locally developed servers
To inspect servers locally developed or downloaded as a repository, the most common way is:

TypeScript
Python

Copy
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  uv \
  --directory path/to/server \
  run \
  package-name \
  args...
Please carefully read any attached README for the most accurate instructions.
