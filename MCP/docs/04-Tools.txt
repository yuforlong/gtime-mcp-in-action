Enable LLMs to perform actions through your server

Tools are a powerful primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enable servers to expose executable functionality to clients. Through tools, LLMs can interact with external systems, perform computations, and take actions in the real world.

Tools are designed to be model-controlled, meaning that tools are exposed from servers to clients with the intention of the AI model being able to automatically invoke them (with a human in the loop to grant approval).

​
Overview
Tools in MCP allow servers to expose executable functions that can be invoked by clients and used by LLMs to perform actions. Key aspects of tools include:

Discovery: Clients can list available tools through the tools/list endpoint
Invocation: Tools are called using the tools/call endpoint, where servers perform the requested operation and return results
Flexibility: Tools can range from simple calculations to complex API interactions
Like resources, tools are identified by unique names and can include descriptions to guide their usage. However, unlike resources, tools represent dynamic operations that can modify state or interact with external systems.

​
Tool definition structure
Each tool is defined with the following structure:


Copy
{
  name: string;          // Unique identifier for the tool
  description?: string;  // Human-readable description
  inputSchema: {         // JSON Schema for the tool's parameters
    type: "object",
    properties: { ... }  // Tool-specific parameters
  },
  annotations?: {        // Optional hints about tool behavior
    title?: string;      // Human-readable title for the tool
    readOnlyHint?: boolean;    // If true, the tool does not modify its environment
    destructiveHint?: boolean; // If true, the tool may perform destructive updates
    idempotentHint?: boolean;  // If true, repeated calls with same args have no additional effect
    openWorldHint?: boolean;   // If true, tool interacts with external entities
  }
}
​
Implementing tools
Here’s an example of implementing a basic tool in an MCP server:

TypeScript
Python

Copy
const server = new Server({
  name: "example-server",
  version: "1.0.0"
}, {
  capabilities: {
    tools: {}
  }
});

// Define available tools
server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => {
  return {
    tools: [{
      name: "calculate_sum",
      description: "Add two numbers together",
      inputSchema: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          a: { type: "number" },
          b: { type: "number" }
        },
        required: ["a", "b"]
      }
    }]
  };
});

// Handle tool execution
server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {
  if (request.params.name === "calculate_sum") {
    const { a, b } = request.params.arguments;
    return {
      content: [
        {
          type: "text",
          text: String(a + b)
        }
      ]
    };
  }
  throw new Error("Tool not found");
});
​
Example tool patterns
Here are some examples of types of tools that a server could provide:

​
System operations
Tools that interact with the local system:


Copy
{
  name: "execute_command",
  description: "Run a shell command",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      command: { type: "string" },
      args: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } }
    }
  }
}
​
API integrations
Tools that wrap external APIs:


Copy
{
  name: "github_create_issue",
  description: "Create a GitHub issue",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      title: { type: "string" },
      body: { type: "string" },
      labels: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } }
    }
  }
}
​
Data processing
Tools that transform or analyze data:


Copy
{
  name: "analyze_csv",
  description: "Analyze a CSV file",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      filepath: { type: "string" },
      operations: {
        type: "array",
        items: {
          enum: ["sum", "average", "count"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
​
Best practices
When implementing tools:

Provide clear, descriptive names and descriptions
Use detailed JSON Schema definitions for parameters
Include examples in tool descriptions to demonstrate how the model should use them
Implement proper error handling and validation
Use progress reporting for long operations
Keep tool operations focused and atomic
Document expected return value structures
Implement proper timeouts
Consider rate limiting for resource-intensive operations
Log tool usage for debugging and monitoring
​
Security considerations
When exposing tools:

​
Input validation
Validate all parameters against the schema
Sanitize file paths and system commands
Validate URLs and external identifiers
Check parameter sizes and ranges
Prevent command injection
​
Access control
Implement authentication where needed
Use appropriate authorization checks
Audit tool usage
Rate limit requests
Monitor for abuse
​
Error handling
Don’t expose internal errors to clients
Log security-relevant errors
Handle timeouts appropriately
Clean up resources after errors
Validate return values
​
Tool discovery and updates
MCP supports dynamic tool discovery:

Clients can list available tools at any time
Servers can notify clients when tools change using notifications/tools/list_changed
Tools can be added or removed during runtime
Tool definitions can be updated (though this should be done carefully)
​
Error handling
Tool errors should be reported within the result object, not as MCP protocol-level errors. This allows the LLM to see and potentially handle the error. When a tool encounters an error:

Set isError to true in the result
Include error details in the content array
Here’s an example of proper error handling for tools:

TypeScript
Python

Copy
try:
    # Tool operation
    result = perform_operation()
    return types.CallToolResult(
        content=[
            types.TextContent(
                type="text",
                text=f"Operation successful: {result}"
            )
        ]
    )
except Exception as error:
    return types.CallToolResult(
        isError=True,
        content=[
            types.TextContent(
                type="text",
                text=f"Error: {str(error)}"
            )
        ]
    )
This approach allows the LLM to see that an error occurred and potentially take corrective action or request human intervention.

​
Tool annotations
Tool annotations provide additional metadata about a tool’s behavior, helping clients understand how to present and manage tools. These annotations are hints that describe the nature and impact of a tool, but should not be relied upon for security decisions.

​
Purpose of tool annotations
Tool annotations serve several key purposes:

Provide UX-specific information without affecting model context
Help clients categorize and present tools appropriately
Convey information about a tool’s potential side effects
Assist in developing intuitive interfaces for tool approval
​
Available tool annotations
The MCP specification defines the following annotations for tools:

Annotation	Type	Default	Description
title	string	-	A human-readable title for the tool, useful for UI display
readOnlyHint	boolean	false	If true, indicates the tool does not modify its environment
destructiveHint	boolean	true	If true, the tool may perform destructive updates (only meaningful when readOnlyHint is false)
idempotentHint	boolean	false	If true, calling the tool repeatedly with the same arguments has no additional effect (only meaningful when readOnlyHint is false)
openWorldHint	boolean	true	If true, the tool may interact with an “open world” of external entities
​
Example usage
Here’s how to define tools with annotations for different scenarios:


Copy
// A read-only search tool
{
  name: "web_search",
  description: "Search the web for information",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      query: { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["query"]
  },
  annotations: {
    title: "Web Search",
    readOnlyHint: true,
    openWorldHint: true
  }
}

// A destructive file deletion tool
{
  name: "delete_file",
  description: "Delete a file from the filesystem",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      path: { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["path"]
  },
  annotations: {
    title: "Delete File",
    readOnlyHint: false,
    destructiveHint: true,
    idempotentHint: true,
    openWorldHint: false
  }
}

// A non-destructive database record creation tool
{
  name: "create_record",
  description: "Create a new record in the database",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      table: { type: "string" },
      data: { type: "object" }
    },
    required: ["table", "data"]
  },
  annotations: {
    title: "Create Database Record",
    readOnlyHint: false,
    destructiveHint: false,
    idempotentHint: false,
    openWorldHint: false
  }
}
​
Integrating annotations in server implementation
TypeScript
Python

Copy
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("example-server")

@mcp.tool(
    annotations={
        "title": "Calculate Sum",
        "readOnlyHint": True,
        "openWorldHint": False
    }
)
async def calculate_sum(a: float, b: float) -> str:
    """Add two numbers together.
    
    Args:
        a: First number to add
        b: Second number to add
    """
    result = a + b
    return str(result)
​
Best practices for tool annotations
Be accurate about side effects: Clearly indicate whether a tool modifies its environment and whether those modifications are destructive.

Use descriptive titles: Provide human-friendly titles that clearly describe the tool’s purpose.

Indicate idempotency properly: Mark tools as idempotent only if repeated calls with the same arguments truly have no additional effect.

Set appropriate open/closed world hints: Indicate whether a tool interacts with a closed system (like a database) or an open system (like the web).

Remember annotations are hints: All properties in ToolAnnotations are hints and not guaranteed to provide a faithful description of tool behavior. Clients should never make security-critical decisions based solely on annotations.

​
Testing tools
A comprehensive testing strategy for MCP tools should cover:

Functional testing: Verify tools execute correctly with valid inputs and handle invalid inputs appropriately
Integration testing: Test tool interaction with external systems using both real and mocked dependencies
Security testing: Validate authentication, authorization, input sanitization, and rate limiting
Performance testing: Check behavior under load, timeout handling, and resource cleanup
Error handling: Ensure tools properly report errors through the MCP protocol and clean up resources
