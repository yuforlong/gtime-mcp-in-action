Get started with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

C# SDK released! Check out what else is new.
MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

​
Why MCP?
MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:

A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure
​
General architecture
At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers:

Internet

Your Computer

MCP Protocol

MCP Protocol

Web APIs

(Claude, IDEs, Tools)

MCP Server A

MCP Server B

MCP Server C

MCP Hosts: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
MCP Clients: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
MCP Servers: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
Local Data Sources: Your computer’s files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
Remote Services: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to
