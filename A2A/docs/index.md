## A2A: Unlock collaborative agent-to-agent scenarios with a new open protocol

- Seamless Agent Collaboration: Introduces a standard protocol for autonomous,
  opaque agents built on different frameworks and by various vendors to
  communicate and collaborate effectively with each other and with users,
  addressing the current lack of agent interoperability.

- Simplifies Enterprise Agent Integration: Provides a straightforward way to
  integrate intelligent agents into existing enterprise applications, allowing
  businesses to leverage agent capabilities across their technology landscape.

- Supports Key Enterprise Requirements: Offers core functionalities essential
  for secure, enterprise-grade agent ecosystems, including capability discovery,
  user experience negotiation, task and state management, and secure
  collaboration. Open standards for connecting Agents

- MCP (Model Context Protocol) for tools and resources
    - Connect agents to tools, APIs, and resources with structured inputs/outputs.
    - Google ADK supports MCP tools. Enabling wide range of MCP servers to be used with agents.
- A2A (Agent2Agent Protocol) for agent-agent collaboration
    - Dynamic, multimodal communication between different agents without sharing memory, resources, and tools
    - Open standard driven by community.
    - Samples available using Google ADK, LangGraph, Crew.AI

## Community Feedback and Roadmap

A2A is a work in progress and is expected to change based on
[community feedback](https://google.github.io/A2A/#/community). This repo
contains the initial specification, documentation, and
[sample code](https://github.com/google/A2A/tree/main/samples). We will continue
to update this repository with more features, more examples, specs, and libraries as
they become available. When the spec and samples can graduate to a production
quality SDK, we will declare version 1.0 and maintain stable releases.

To understand A2A design principles and external partners supporting A2A, read
our blog post on
[Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/).
